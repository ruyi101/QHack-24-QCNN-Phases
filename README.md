## Abstract

In this project, we explore the application of a quantum convolutional neural network model for phase identification. Our investigation involves training regression and classification models to identify phases and phase transitions within both the Transverse Field Ising Model and $\mathbb{Z}_2 \times \mathbb{Z}_2$ Symmetry Protected Topological Phase model. While our regression model, utilizing shallow circuitry, performs reasonably, the classification models initially underperform. However, leveraging GPU acceleration, we enhance the classification models by increasing circuit depth, resulting in significant performance improvements. Additionally, we evaluate the robustness of our models on IonQ's quantum device using the AWS Bracket hybrid job tool.
